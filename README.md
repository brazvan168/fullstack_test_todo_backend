# To-Do Application - Backend

This is the backend of a basic to-do app built with Node.js and Express.

## Description

* This project was built in order for me to showcase my abilities in building a REST API with Node.js and Express.
* It was created for a simple to-do app, and so it contains only a few endpoints.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Windows 10
* Node v20.14.0 (LTS) with npm 10.7.0

### Installing

* Open up your terminal, navigate to the project's root directory and run:
```
npm install
```

### Running the app

* Make sure the port 3001 is not already in use by some other application

* Simply run the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
